# linear_algebra
Naive python implementation for eudcational purpose, not industrial.  
Written by dummyIndex, an incoming freshman at UCSB during MATH 4A(now) in FSSP.  
Run "run.py" in your console or in python REPL (only supports invertible matrices).  
Or if you know python, just import the functions from the "source" module, which are more helpful than the run run.py, an interface for students without programming experience.  
Docs for the functions may be added later.  

Now supports windows and linux's console!  

Basic operations on Matrices and vectors are available!  

Vector-vector, matrix-matrix addition  
matrix-matrix, matrix- vector, vector-matrix multiplication  
scalar-matrix, scalar-vector multiplication.  
  
Available service:    
3.Invertible Matrices  
  
Classes:
  Vec- a vector, take a list as the argument  
    operators:*,-,+  
  Mat- a matrix, take a 2D list as the argument  
    operators:*,-,+  


APIs:  
solve_homogenious  
inv_mat  
row_reduce 
check_eigenvalue  
orthogonalize  
det- the method of Mat, which return determinants by cofactor definition  
length- the method of Vec, which return the length of a vector under dot-product definition  

Waitlists:  
change of basis 
eigenvectors  
(following not included in MATH 4A)  
QR factorization  
Singular Value Decomposition  
LU  


##Graphic Interface needed!!!!!!!

Tortured by history 2A! no time left to implement anything before 2015.9.12.
