# linear_algebra
Naive python implementation for eudcational purpose, not industrial.  
Written by dummyIndex, an incoming freshman at UCSB during MATH 4A(now) in FSSP.  
Just run "run.py" in your console or in python REPL.  
Docs for the functions may be added later.  

Now supports windows and linux's console!  

Basic operations on Matrices and vectors are available!  

Vector-vector, matrix-matrix addition  
matrix-matrix, matrix- vector, vector-matrix multiplication  
scalar-matrix, scalar-vector multiplication.  
  
  
Available service:    
3.Invertible Matrices  
  
  
Implemented functions:  
solve_homogenious  
inv_mat  
row_reduce  


Future waitlists:  
eigenvectors  
change of basis  

  
(following not included in MATH 4A)  
QR factorization  
Singular Value Decomposition  
LU  


##Graphic Interface needed!!!!!!!
