# linear_algebra
Naive python implementation for eudcational purpose, not industrial
Written by dummyIndex, a student in UCSB.
Just run "run.py" in your console or in python REPL.
Docs for the functions may be added later.

PLEASE NOTE, THE RUN MODULE CALLS CLEAR, SO THERE'S PROBLEM WITH WINDOWS, I MAY FIX IT LATER. IT'S EASY BUT I NEED TO ADD NEW FEATURES FOR MYSELF FIRST. :-)
