# linear_algebra
Naive python implementation for educational purpose, not industrial.  
Written by dummyIndex, in 2015 August. 2019er, undergraduate, freshman year in 2015.
Run "run.py" in your console or in python REPL (only supports invertible matrices).  
Or if you know python, just import the functions from the "source" module, which are more helpful than run() in run module, an interface for students without programming experience.  

Brief overview:  

Basic operations on Matrices and vectors are available!  

Vector-vector, matrix-matrix addition  
matrix-matrix, matrix- vector, vector-matrix multiplication  
scalar-matrix, scalar-vector multiplication.  
  
Available service:    
3.Invertible Matrices  
  
Classes:  
  Vec- a vector, take a list as the argument  
    operators:\*,-,+  
  Mat- a matrix, take a 2D list as the argument  
    operators:\*,-,+  


APIs:  
solve_homogenious  
inv_mat  
row_reduce  
check_eigenvalue  
orthogonalize  
transition_matrix
det- the method of Mat, which return determinants by cofactor definition  
length- the method of Vec, which return the length of a vector under dot-product definition  

Waitlists:
eigenvectors  
(following not included in MATH 4A)  
QR factorization  
Singular Value Decomposition  
LU  


##Graphic Interface needed!!!!!!!

Tortured by history 2A! no time left to implement anything before 2015.9.12.
Have time to implement but I'm solving other problems. If you have any need, feel free to email me or notify me through weibo or wechat or facebook or twitter or text.
