# linear_algebra
Naive python implementation for eudcational purpose, not industrial.  
Written by dummyIndex, an incoming freshman at UCSB during MATH 4A(now) in FSSP.  
Just run "run.py" in your console or in python REPL.  
Docs for the functions may be added later.  

Now supports windows and linux's console!  

Basic operations on Matrices and vectors are available!  

Vector-vector, matrix-matrix addition  
matrix-matrix, matrix- vector, vector-matrix multiplication  
scalar-matrix, scalar-vector multiplication.  

vec.length returns its length under dot product's definition
